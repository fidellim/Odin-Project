                    The best crab cakes showcase crabmeat in all its deliciousness, with the other ingredients playing back-up to
                    the main
                    attraction. Some cracker crumbs and egg hold the patties together, while a little mayo, mustard, and seasoning
                    accentuate the flavors. When done right, crab cakes are always a big hit with seafood lovers everywhere.
                    <br />
                    Traditionally, Maryland crab cakes tend to be made with crabs caught in the Chesapeake Bay and are often
                    flavored with
                    Old Bay seasoning. For the best results, don't over-work the mixture so that the patties have nice big flakes of
                    crab
                    and, after forming into patties, let chill before cooking. Saltines are the perfect filler for crab cakes since
                    they
                    offer structure and some saltiness without masking the crab.
                    <br />
                    Serve crab cakes with fresh lemon and tartar sauce, remoulade, or crab cake sauce as a fun appetizer. For a
                    light lunch,
                    pair them with a lemony arugula or walnut and apple salad.

                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Drain the crabmeat and pick through it, discarding any shells and cartilage. Put the crabmeat in a bowl and
                        set it
                        aside.</li>
                    <li>Crush the saltine crackers until very fine and mix with the egg, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Old Bay,
                        Worcestershire
                        sauce, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Fold in the crab gently. Only mix enough to combine ingredients (take care not to break up the crab into
                        fine shreds).</li>
                    <li>Shape into 6 crab cakes, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the crab cakes until golden
                        brown, 3 to 5
                        minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.</li>
                    <li>Serve the crab cakes with tartar sauce, remoulade, or simply with a squeeze of lemon.</li>
                </ol>
