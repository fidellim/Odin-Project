            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Be warned, classic French pork rillettes are not a pâté, as you will find to your peril should you ever use the term
                in
                France. Rillettes are long, slow-cooked meats, usually cooked in their own fat, and a few herbs and seasoning. What
                is
                created by the long slow cooking is akin to pulled pork with a softer flavor. They are, quite simply, delicious.
                <br/>
                Spread rillettes on toasted baguette, sprinkle lightly with freshly cracked black pepper and salt for a quick, easy
                appetizer. For a bold flavor or gourmet appetizer spread the toasts with fig jam; the sweet jam and pork work so
                well
                together.

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325F.</li>
                <li>In a large ovenproof baking dish, mix all the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Tightly cover the dish with foil or a well-fitting lid.</li>
                <li>Cook in the center of the oven for 3 hours, until the meat is falling apart. It is imperative to keep checking
                    the dish
                    to make sure the meat is not drying out as it cooks; add more water if needed.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, remove the dish from the heat, leave the foil or lid in place and allow the meat to cool in the
                    dish for 30 to 45 minutes until it is warm.</li>
                <li>Remove the lid and discard the bay leaf and duck bones and any little pieces of meat which may have dried too
                    far.</li>
                <li>Shred and stir the meat and fat with a large fork until it resembles a chunky, creamy spread, if correctly
                    cooked this
                    will be very easy to do.</li>
                <li>Place the rillettes in a beautiful serving pot and level with the back of a spoon.</li>
                <li>Pour any remaining fat in the cooking dish over the surface to help keep the rillettes moist.</li>
                <li>Chill the pâté for at least 24 hours before serving.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
